# Elite AI Agent
# elite-ai-agent

## 1. Introduction 🚀

elite-ai-agent is an autonomous AI Strategist Agent that discovers, builds, and monetizes niche SaaS tools using AI together with low-code/no-code stacks. Think of it as a hands-on digital co‑founder: it researches underserved markets, designs product and pricing strategies, generates an MVP using tools like Bubble, Retool, or Streamlit, and wires up monetization and analytics so a viable product can start earning revenue quickly.

This project is built with a modular Python core and clear agent boundaries (researcher, strategist, builder, monetizer). It's designed to be extensible, auditable, and deployable on laptops, cloud instances, or mobile Termux environments for prototyping on-the-go.

## 4. Quick Start (Termux) ⚡

Prerequisites: Termux installed on an Android device, 4 GB+ free storage, and a network connection.

Copy and paste these exact commands into Termux:

```sh
# Update Termux packages
pkg update -y && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install -y git python clang make curl wget zip unzip

# Optional: Node.js for the UI
pkg install -y nodejs

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/oppojajkhan/elite-ai-agent.git
cd elite-ai-agent

# Create and activate a Python virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional: install UI dependencies (if using nextjs-app)
cd ui/nextjs-app && npm install && cd ../../

# Configure environment variables (API keys, providers)
chmod +x scripts/setup_env.sh
./scripts/setup_env.sh

# Launch the strategist agent (example: full pipeline)
python scripts/run_agent.py --mode full
```

Stop the agent with Ctrl+C. Edit scripts/*.py and agents/* to customize behavior, LLM adapters, or monetization strategies.
